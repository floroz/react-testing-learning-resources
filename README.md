React Testing (Jest, Enzyme, React Testing Library): Learning Resources




 
Testing is a vast subject and no documentation could comprehensively cover all its applications and practices.


**Jest**:

  

[Jest: Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started): the official documentation allows you to get started with Jest and be familiar with its extensive API.

There are many libraries that enhance Jest functionalities and matchers, one we currently use and it’s worth checking out is [Jest-DOM](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom).

  

[Testing JavaScript with Kent C. Dodd (PAID)](https://testingjavascript.com/): This large online course covers the fundamentals of JavaScript testing principles in great detail.

Kent C. Dodd is the library author of React Testing Library and shows from scratch the library implementation under the hood, which enables the developers to further understand how to best use its tool.

Jest is extensively covered throughout this course. Additional topics covered are Node API testing and Cypress.

**Enzyme**:

  

[Enzyme - Introduction](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/energy-and-enzymes/introduction-to-enzymes/a/enzymes-and-the-active-site): official airbnb enzyme docs for getting started.

  

[Udemy - 2019 Update! React Testing with Jest and Enzyme (PAID)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-with-jest-and-enzyme/) : online course on how to use enzyme and developing React Components using TDD, covering Redux and Context API.

  

**React Testing Library (RTL):**

[Kent C. Dodds workshop (PAID)](https://kentcdodds.com/workshops/)

  

TestingJavaScript.com and Kent C. Dodds paid workshop remains the most comprehensive (and expensive) resource available both on Jest and RTL applications.

  

It’s important to remember that RTL is built on top of the core library [DOM Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library), a very light-weight solution for testing DOM nodes.

  

React Testing Library adds an API for working with React Components.
